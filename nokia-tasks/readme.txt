Your task this week is to submit a very basic calculator using the technology you discussed in class. 
The better and more creative your implementation is the more recognition you will get. ;-)

Submit your entire project files in a folder called "user-YOURNICKNAME" (just like the HTML task convention.) 
A sample directory exists illustrating the proper hieararchy.
