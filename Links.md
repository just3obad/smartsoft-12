Hi all,

These are the links that I found most useful for me.

1- For CSS :-  Twitter bootstrap =====> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
> as I told you navigate through the top tabs in it. (Mina will give as an insight on it tomorrow).
2- For Links on rails (a complete resource where you can search for anything...
http://railscasts.com/   is really amazing.

3- For Javascript ===> I personally like javascript w3schools link and find them the most useful http://www.w3schools.com/js/

4- I found the tutorials that Mina sent in the second mail really really nice. http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2

And Yet the best video tutorials I have seen till now are not free on the website but I have them on my laptop so I ask everyone of you
to please get a usb with him/her to take them.
